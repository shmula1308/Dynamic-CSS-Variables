# Dynamic CSS Variables

This app changes the value of a CSS variable at the root level with Javascript.

I've used BEM naming convention in the HTML.

The challenge is from here: https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Dynamic-CSSVar-app.md

## User Stories

- [ ] User can see three two boxes to be used to enter a User ID and Password
      along with 'Cancel' and 'Login' buttons underneath them. The default background
      color of the text boxes is white.
- [ ] User can enter a user id and password into the text boxes.
- [ ] User can click the 'Login' button to validate the user id and password.
- [ ] User can see a warning message if one or both of the text boxes contains
      spaces and the background color of the empty text box will change to light
      yellow.
- [ ] User can see a warning message if the user id doesn't match 'testuser'
      and the background color of the text box will change to light red.
- [ ] User can see a warning message if the password doesn't match 'mypassword'
      and the background color of the text box will change to light red.

      their background colors to white.
